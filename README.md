# socialFrontiers

The intention of this repo is to contain analysis code for the new NordF project alongside development code from the old social-frontier package (now no longer being worked on).

I have chosen to work in an R package code to organise documentation and so forth (as well as keep up to date on version control) across the three year project.

Need to install INLA:
